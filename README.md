## 👀 About PRO-DSC
<!-- Subspace clustering is a classical unsupervised learning task, built on a basic assumption that high-dimensional data can be approximated by a union of subspaces (UoS). Nevertheless, the real-world data are often deviating from the UoS assumption. To address this challenge, state-of-the-art deep subspace clustering algorithms attempt to jointly learn UoS representations and self-expressive coefficients. However, the general framework of the existing algorithms suffers from feature collapse and lacks a theoretical guarantee to learn desired UoS representation.  -->
PRO-DSC (Principled fRamewOrk for Deep Subspace Clustering) is designed to learn structured representations and self-expressive coefficients in a unified manner. Specifically, in PRO-DSC, we incorporate an effective regularization on the learned representations into the self-expressive model, and prove that the regularized self-expressive model is able to prevent feature space collapse and the learned optimal representations under certain condition lie on a union of orthogonal subspaces. 
<!-- Moreover, we provide a scalable and efficient approach to implement our PRO-DSC and conduct extensive experiments to verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed deep subspace clustering approach. -->

## Clustering on the CLIP Features
Step 1: Download the extracted CLIP features from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L9jH8zRF3To6Hb_B0UZ6PbknhgusWm5_?usp=drive_link) and put them under `./data/datasets`

Step 2: Train PRO-DSC by running:

```sh
python main.py --data cifar10/cifar100/cifar20/tinyimagenet/imagenet/imagenetdogs
```

## Clustering on Classical Subspace Clustering Benchmarks
Step 1: Download the datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C4qlqYOW4-YulIwgkNfqMM7dZ2O5-BK_?usp=sharing) and put them under `./data/datasets`

Step 2: Train PRO-DSC by running:

```sh
python main_subspace.py --data eyaleb/orl/coil100
```
